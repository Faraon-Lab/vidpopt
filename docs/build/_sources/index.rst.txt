Welcome to Vipdopt's documentation!
===================================

``vipdopt`` (/vɪpdɑpt/) is a Python library for streamlining the process of **v**\olumetric
**i**\nverse **p**\hotonic **d**\esign and **opt**\imization. It
makes use of Lumerical's Python API ``lumapi`` to make the design and optimization of new
optical devices more straightforward.
